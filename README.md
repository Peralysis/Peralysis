<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Peralysis</h2>

I'm a web and game developer with a passion for learning about new tools and technologies. 
I have a particular love for DevOps and work full-time as the Manager of DevOps & Standards at [Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/).

I'm well-versed in C# and C++, have a strong knowlege of game development using Unreal Engine and Unity and 
have been working with [Sitecore](https://www.sitecore.com/) for 11 years.

I have a few plates spinning at the moment:
- I'm working on a couple games ðŸ¤«
- I'm learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- I'm learning to make procedural art using tools like Houdini, Blender and Substance Designer
